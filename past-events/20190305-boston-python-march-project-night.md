Pizza sponsored by BitSight (https://www.bitsight.com/)

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: anything goes at Project Night.

You don't need to have a project, and you don't have to show anything to anyone! This is an opportunity to work together with like-minded people. There's no presentation, just people working on whatever they want to work on. That's it!

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Maybe you have another idea? Bring it!
