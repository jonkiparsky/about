An evening with Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Frank Wiles, and Alex Gaynor

These three luminaries from Django, PyPy, and the Python world in general will be in town for an informal panel discussion. The discussion will be wide-ranging, authoritative, opinionated, illuminating, and entertaining. Bring any and all topics! A list of questions is growing at http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=1d669f .

Jacob Kaplan-Moss is an original author of Django and is now a co-BDFL (https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/) of the Django project. Frank Wiles is the founder of Revolution Systems and a longtime Open Source leader. Alex Gaynor is a prolific contributor to Django, PyPy, and the Python core.

Revolution Systems and Lab305 have made the night possible by bringing everyone to Boston.

Location: Room 32-155 in the Stata Center at MIT (http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=32), aka room 155 on the 1st floor of 32 Vassar Street.

Video will be broadcast on http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bostonpython .

Tonight's pizza is sponsored by Lab305 (http://www.lab305.com/). Kyruus (http://kyruus.com/home/) is sponsoring drinks at Meadhall after the event. Thanks Lab305 and Kyruus!
