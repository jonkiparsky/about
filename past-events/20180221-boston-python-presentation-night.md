DataDog will provide pizza. The Cambridge Innovation Center is providing space tonight.

We have three talks of varying lengths:

Stephanie Marker, Predicting the price of Ether with an LSTM RNN

Using long short-term memory recurrent neural networks models (from Keras) I attempt to predict the price of the Ether cryptocurrency. The talk will be a high level overview of how to work with time series data, including data preprocessing, formatting the data as a time series, normalization, feature selection, model parameter selection, fitting a model, evaluating a model's performance, and forecasting.

Michael McMahon, Using Python and Sphinx to Develop a Role Playing Game

Michael Dezube, Options for parallel processing in Python

Have a lot of computing to do? Maybe you can use all those CPU cores in your laptop! Or maybe not. We'll demonstrate a number of options for how to do more work on one computer from Python. Covered will be threads, multiprocessing, Cython, Numpy, and Numba.
