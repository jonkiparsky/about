Follow Snake Charmers,

October's Meetup will consist of two sessions. The first is the "Pimp My Code" Challenge. Peter Beardsley has volunteered to provide some code for everyone to review and improve -- aka "Pimp." Keep an eye out for Peter's code on the mail list then get to work adding headrest LCD's and a hot tub in the truck. We can't wait to see your suggestions.

In the second half, George Lambert will present a session we are calling "Werkzeug: Less than a Framework, more than a Toolkit." It will provide an introduction to Werkzeug, one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules.

Thanks to Peter and George -- and to each of you that help make this such a great community.

Peter M.
