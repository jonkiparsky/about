September 26, 2018


   

Pizza sponsored by Quantopian (https://www.quantopian.com), drinks after sponsored by Luminoso (https://luminoso.com).

Two talks tonight:

Kostya Nazarenko, The magic of CFFI
A gentle applied introduction to the latest, and some would argue hottest, addition to the family of foreign function invocation libraries. If you need to call an existing C library from your Python application and not sure where to start - this talk might help you to make a decision!

Jared Stufft: Intro to Neural Networks with Keras
In this talk we'll introduce the idea of the Neural Network: what they are, why they're used, and how they work. We'll wrap up with a demonstration and code example using Keras, a neural network API designed for humans.

We'll head to Meadhall afterwards for drinks!
