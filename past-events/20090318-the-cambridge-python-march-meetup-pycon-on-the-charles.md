Pycon on the Charles

Pycon 2009 is happening in Chicago, March 27-29. If you can't be there, we'll bring three speakers to you!

On March 18, three Boston-area Pycon speakers will preview their talks at the Python Meetup. To fit it all in, we're going to start just a little early.

Please note the earlier start time of 6:30.

Presenters:

Jack Diederich: Class Decorators: Radically Simple (http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/55/)
Jesse Noller: Concurrency and Distributed Computing with Python Today (http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/69/)
Owen Taylor: Reinteract: a better way to interact with Python (http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/23/)

It should be a really fun and informative evening, maybe even with snacks!
