Needs a location

   

Fellow Snake Charmers,

April showers bring May flowers. We're going to give our flowers a little more time to blossom. So this months meeting is pushed back a week and now schedule for Wednesday April 23. (Business trip.)

On that date, Python Meetup member "flajann" (Fred) will walk us through his "TinyURL" clone built entirely in Python.

Fred's app will provide us with an opportunity to discuss and ask questions about developing Python applications and logic that interact with web servers.

Pizza and soda will be served. Donations are appreciated as usual to pay for Meetup and the food.

Thanks!

Peter
