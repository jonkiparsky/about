June 25, 2014


   

Come hear about peoples' solutions to the project night puzzles (http://puzzles.bostonpython.com)! Sponsored by Red Hat (http://www.redhat.com) and Kyruus (http://kyruus.com/).

If you've been to a project night, you know we often have puzzles (http://puzzles.bostonpython.com) there. Different people solve the puzzles differently. We'll have solvers show us their code, explain their approach, and teach us some Python along the way. It will be fun, interactive, and instructive!

Try out the puzzles yourself beforehand! We'll have people talking about solutions to at least:

• A Hot Date with itertools (http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/hotdate.html),

• Twitter Puddle (http://programmingpraxis.com/2013/11/15/twitter-puddle/), and

• Python Poetry (http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/poetry.html).

Red Hat (http://www.redhat.com) is sponsoring pizza.

Kyruus (http://kyruus.com/) is sponsoring drinks afterwards at Meadhall.
