Learn and practice Python basics with this full-day project-driven workshop!

On Friday evening, come by for an hour any time between 5 and 8pm to set up your development environment.

On Saturday, we'll spend the morning on an introduction to the language, taking breaks to practice concepts on bite-sized exercises. In the afternoon, we'll hack on two projects: a web application in Django and visual effects for a programmable "color wall".

Audience: Women and their friends who have no or limited programming experience.

Our goal is to provide a comfortable environment in which women can develop their programming skills with confidence. Our staff are predominantly women from the Boston programming and open source communities.
