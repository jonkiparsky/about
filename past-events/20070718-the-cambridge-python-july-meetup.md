Needs a location

   

Members, Python Newbies, Certified Snake Charmers and this month Ruby-Lovers!

Hope you can all make it to the next Python Meetup when Special Guest Chris Bowen from Microsoft will talk about Python's role in Microsoft's SilverLight.

Silverlight aims to compete with Adobe Flash and the presentation components of Ajax. It supports Python and Ruby so this would be a good session for all those Ruby-lovers out there.

If you'd like to learn more about Silverlight before the meeting check out these links to voidspace techie blog and Wikipedia for more info.

This month's agenda: News and Events, Microsoft Silverlight, General Discussion

Please let us know if you'd like to do a Lighting Talk on a current project, technical problem, solution or innovation at a future meeting.

Look forward to seeing you all.

Drop me a line if you have any questions or suggestions.

Peter
