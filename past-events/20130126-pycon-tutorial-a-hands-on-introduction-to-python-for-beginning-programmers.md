In preparation for her PyCon tutorial, Jessica will rehearse it for Boston Python members.

Jessica McKellar, A hands-on introduction to Python for beginning programmers (https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/1/)

Beginning programmers: Jump start your Python and programming careers with this 3-hour interactive tutorial. By the end, you'll have hands-on exposure to many core programming concepts, be able to write useful Python programs, and have a roadmap for continuing to learn and practice programming in Python. This class assumes no prior programming experience.

We'll cover:

Python as a calculator Basic data types Interactive programs: input and output Making choices: booleans and flow control Lists and iteration Functions We'll also practice writing Python scripts, see demos of cool Python applications, and take a quick tour of popular Python libraries.

PyCon tutorials are half-day in-depth courses presented in the days preceding the bulk of PyCon. Rehearsing with a real audience is a great way to prepare. Come ready to learn, and also to provide feedback!
