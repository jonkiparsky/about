Hosted by Wayfair, with pizza sponsored by Indigo (https://www.indigoag.com/)

Tonight, a deep dive into Web Scraping. Edward Stronge and Isaac Vidas will present a two-part talk about getting data from a web site by reading and parsing the HTML. This is a very popular technique, but there are pitfalls along the way. Starting from the basics, they will get you up to speed on the power of web scraping.
