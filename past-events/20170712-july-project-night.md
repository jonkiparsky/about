July 12, 2017


   

An evening of collegial cooperation, sponsored by O'Reilly (https://www.oreilly.com/) and their JupyterCon (https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny) conference.

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. Bring friends. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests, and work away. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: it all happens at Project Night.

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Anything goes!

Pizza will be provided by O'Reilly! You can't be friendly, helpful, and productive if you're hungry...
