Four presenters will tell us about their hardware projects. Three are Raspberry Pi projects, and the last is a hardware alternative to the Rasp Pi.

Pizza for this event is sponsored by Creare (http://www.creare.com/).

Drinks after the event at Meadhall are sponsored by Scout (http://goscoutgo.com/).

Our four presenters are Mike Milkin, Nash Reilly, Dag Holmboe, and Joseph Okor.

The Raspberry Pi is an affordable credit-card-sized computer. Hardware hobbyists use it to power all sorts of projects. Tonight we'll hear about a web-powered remote control car, a GMail/Twitter monitor, and a bus beacon. No hardware experience is needed to appreciate the ingenuity of these projects.
