For September, we're back to school: Beginner's Night is for those that want to learn about Python from first principles.

Ned will present a whirlwind introduction to Python. Aimed at developers new to the language, we'll cover some real Python code line-by-line, explaining the core principles of the language as we go.

Interested in Python, but don't know where to start? Come find out what people love about the language. Have friends who don't understand why you keep going on and on about how wonderful Python is? Bring them along! Already a Python expert? Come to help point out the finer details, and brush up on subtleties you've missed.

The event is free, and all are welcome. We'll have a lively discussion, and all questions are fair game. Plenty of experts will be on hand to help.

Pizza will be provided by Microsoft, and we'll have a few door prizes to give away. The NERD center is on Memorial Drive, overlooking the Boston skyline. Parking is $10 in the basement garage, or there are other parking alternatives nearby.

Shmoozing at 6:30, coherent presentation starting at 7:00.
