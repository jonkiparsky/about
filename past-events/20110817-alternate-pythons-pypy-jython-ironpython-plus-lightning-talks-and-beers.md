One of the fascinating features of the Python ecosystem is the variety of implementations of the language. In addition to the classic CPython, there's:

Jython, running on the Java Virtual Machine IronPython, running on the .NET platform PyPy, written in Python itself, and faster than CPython! Dave Malcolm will introduce us to these alternate implementations, showing the important advantages each brings, the differences from classic Python, and exploring some tantalizing implementation details. If you've ever wondered whether one of these other implementations was for you, or were just curious about how Python works under the hood, this talk is for you.

We'll also have some lightning talks. If you have a lightning talk you want to give, drop me a line.

As if that's not enough, I'll have a copy of the new book, The Python Standard Library by Example (http://www.doughellmann.com/books/byexample/) to give away. And of course, we'll have pizza donated by O'Reilly Books.

We'll round out the evening at Meadhall for informal socializing. Join us, even if you can't make the presentations. Proxpro will be sponsoring a round of drinks!
