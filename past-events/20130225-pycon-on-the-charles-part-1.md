In preparation for their presentations at PyCon US, Jessica and Nate will rehearse with us! Thanks to Smarterer (http://smarterer.com) for sponsoring the night.

Jessica McKellar: Keynote [All Levels]

Jessica is a director of the Python Software Foundation, and will be speaking inspirationally about Python.

Nate Aune: Deploy your Python app in 5 min with a PaaS [Intermediate]

How can you avoid servers and get back to coding? Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) makes deployment easy. But which PaaS do you choose and how do you get started? This talk will examine several of the leading PaaS providers and discuss their pros/cons. We'll also give examples for how to deploy the same app to each of them to see the differences.
