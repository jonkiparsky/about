Three talks about advanced programming tools, sponsored by Quantopian (http://quantopian.com) and Cogo Labs (http://cogolabs.com).

Andrea Censi: PyContracts

Python is famously untyped. PyContracts (http://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/) is a library that allows you to annotate your functions with type specifications which can be checked at runtime. The best of both worlds?

Laurent Poulain: the Python disassembler

Python is compiled to bytecode, and the dis module lets you examine that bytecode. We'll go through a few examples of how and why.

Joe Jevnik: qdb

Quantopian has implemented their own debugger for use in their specialized environment.

Pizza will be provided by Quantopian. Drinks afterwards at Meadhall, sponsored by Cogo Labs.
