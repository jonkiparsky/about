For our May speaker, we have a real treat! Kenneth Reitz is a luminary in the Python world, and a prized speaker at any Python conference. Thanks to Heroku (http://heroku.com) and Rue La La (http://ruelala.com) for sponsoring.

Python for Humans, Kenneth Reitz

Python’s ecosystem is held up to a high standard, but it falls short in a few key areas. A handful of crucial APIs are an absolute pain to work with. We’ll go over where these APIs went wrong and learn about strong and elegant API design, with particular attention to HTTP requests. The high barriers to entry in Python will be discussed. Potential solutions will be proposed.

We'll also have a broad-topic Q+A discussion.

Then, a few Lightning Talks!

Pizza is sponsored by Rue La La.

Heroku has provided Kenneth and drinks afterwards at Meadhall!
