March 26, 2016


   

A three-hour tutorial on how to make your computer talk to other computers with Python. We'll learn a bit about the internet and the web and will write or modify a TCP chat client, a web server for static content, an HTTP client, and a WSGI-compliant server and web application. We will learn what all those things are and how they fit together, bringing the architecture of modern web apps into better focus.

Because space is limited, in order to attend please join the wait list and then answer a few questions at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14Kdikbpuy8ELBxIsT6qlFZRra6n0Mf0Y-acL-bYCBFI/viewform. If there's room, your RSVP status will be changed after your response to that form is received.

Although no web development experience is necessary to attend, this tutorial may be particularly of interest to those with some web development experience that want to better understand their tools.

If you'd like to volunteer to help participants at this tutorial, send an email to thomasballinger@gmail.com

No food will be provided. Bring a wifi-capable laptop and a power cord.
