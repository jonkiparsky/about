Pizza sponsored by Pluralsight (https://www.pluralsight.com), drinks after sponsored by Soroco (http://soroco.com).

Two speakers on physical computing: tiny hardware running Python, controlling things like lights and motors, and reading data from things like buttons, temperature sensors, and accelerometers.

Dan Halbert and Travis Bumgarner will discuss microprocessor and microcontroller boards like the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit Gemma. What can they do, how can you use them, how do they run Python? You can get involved, you can build things, and you can contribute!

We'll be headed to Meadhall after the event for drinks sponsored by Soroco.
