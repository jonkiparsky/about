NEW LOCATION!

For the November Python meetup, we have Tayeb Al Karim presenting about Testing in Python. Tayeb is a Software Engineer in Test at Google, and will cover a range of topics from the basics of testing your Python code, continuous builds, and how to improve testability with techniques like dependency injection. No matter what type of code you are writing, testing is a must, but many developers have doubts about how to proceed. Whether you are just test-curious or a grizzled expert, it should be an enlightening evening.

We are meeting in a NEW LOCATION: the Microsoft New England R&D Center at One Memorial Drive, Cambridge.
We'll be in the first floor conference center. I'm told there is some parking in the building.

DON'T FORGET: it's in a NEW LOCATION!!!!!! (have I emphasized that enough?)
