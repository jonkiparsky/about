Cris Ewing, Plone theming with Diazo

Plone 5 comes with a brand new theme engine called Diazo (http://diazo.org). Diazo is written in Python and allows you to map content from a dynamic website into a static HTML/CSS theme using a set of rules. Diazo compiles the theme and the rules into an XSLT file which is then used to transform the dynamic content into themed content. Thus: Diazo writes XSLT so you don't have to! Diazo can be used standalone with any dynamic website but it is built into Plone 5, which includes a through-the-web theming tool that makes it easy to get started.

In this training, you’ll learn how to build a great-looking theme for any Plone site based on an off-the-shelf, fully responsive HTML5 layout. Along the way, you’ll learn a bit about how Plone works, and how we can create and manage websites with this fantastic tool. In the end you’ll have a nice, clean Plone site theme you can use on your next Plone project!

All you’ll need to bring is a laptop with wireless and a web browser, we’ll supply the rest.

Cris Ewing has been involved with Plone since 2006 and has served on the board of directors of the Plone Foundation. He teaches web development in Python for the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education program and has established the Python program at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.
