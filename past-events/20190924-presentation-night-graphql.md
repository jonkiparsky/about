GraphQL.py { query(in: 3){ parts } }

Hosted, sponsored, and presented by Chewy.

GraphQL is a new style of API for the web.

Milos Veljkovic (Senior Engineer, Chewy) will begin our query from the outside in by covering the client consumption of graphQL. A bit of history, a bit of romance, a bit of rivalry and an overview of what's the big deal and why there is no REST for the wicked. The focus will be on the empowerment of the client only needing to ask for what they want - and only getting what they ask for.

Now, what do you do with it? Jason Walsh (Senior Engineer, Chewy) continues our fable with the ongoing cycle of software from the server's perspective. State, async, fetching, oh my! As well as some basic implementations, he'll also cover things like tracing, logging, validation and the ongoing maintenance cycle of api.

Jessamyn Hodge (Engineer, Chewy / Maintainer GraphQL-python) wraps things up with a cavort through the innards of GraphQL.py as well as a look ahead to the roadmap for the next major release. She'll cover the nitty-gritty bits like interfaces, unions using another strongly typed specification - geoJSON.
