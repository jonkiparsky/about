Level up your Python through your choice of a dozen fun and practical projects.

We’ll provide the projects and friendly helpers; you bring a laptop and enthusiasm. You’ll rotate through the projects that interest you at your own pace, and we’ll have breaks for demos of awesome Python libraries and applications.

The Projects

Our material is all online. Please visit our wiki for a detailed event description and the full list of projects (https://openhatch.org/wiki/Intermediate_Python_Workshop_2).

We'll have 3 styles of projects for you at this event:

Practice writing Python programs from scratch. Learn a Python library through a bite-sized project. Work through an online tutorial. Projects include:

Building a web application with Django Interacting with a database in Python Data analysis and plotting with Matplotlib Using the Twitter API Regular expressions and cheating at Words with Friends Building a graphical game with PyGame Prerequisites

This event is perfect for you if:

You know Python language basics, including dictionaries, lists, for loops, and writing functions You are comfortable looking up Python information when you need it (example: if you needed to learn about generating random numbers in Python, you'd be comfortable with Googling for and reading through the relevant documentation) and at least one of the following is true:

You want to practice writing programs in Python from scratch You want to learn about and practice more advanced Python/CS concepts, like classes and object-oriented programming You want to learn about and practice using useful Python libraries, for example to talk to a database, make graphs, or create graphical games If you are not sure if this event is appropriate for you, please check out the projects and get in touch with us (https://openhatch.org/wiki/Intermediate_Python_Workshop/Projects)!
