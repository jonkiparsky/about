Needs a location

   

For June, we don't have a formal presentation, but someone suggested delving into the details of how Python software is packaged and distributed. I can show how I've done things, but there's stuff I don't know, so it'll be a collaborative exploration entitled:

** I'll Show You My Package If You'll Show Me Yours **

If you've been confused by setup.py, setuptools, distutils, easy_install, eggs, pip, pypi, and so on, come and see at least part of it de-mystified.

On the other hand, if you know what any of these things are, then come and help educate the rest of us!

We'll be at Betahouse in Central Square. Remember, cheap plentiful parking is just around the corner on at the municipal Green St. garage.
