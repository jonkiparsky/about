Welcome back from summer!

To get back into the Pythonic swing of things, we'll be having an open hack night, Wednesday 9/16. Bring a project or a problem, and get help from fellow Pythonistas. Can't get that weird module installed properly? Is threading twisting your brain in unpleasant ways? Just want a nerd-filled room to quietly work on your side project? You've come to the right place!

Nothing to work on? No expertise (I don't believe you)? Come and watch the nerd sparks fly! Get inspired...

We'll have some time up front for lightning talks: if you have a cool project, an idea, or even a burning question, take the mic for 5 minutes to let us know about it.
