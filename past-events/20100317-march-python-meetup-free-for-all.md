March 17, 2010


   

We've got nothing formal planned, so bring your projects to hack on, bring your questions to be answered, bring your topic to lightning talk on, whatever you want is what will happen.

Pythonistas of all levels are welcome! I hear there might be pizza...

BTW: PyCon 2010 just finished in Atlanta, the videos are posted here: http://pycon.blip.tv/... (http://pycon.blip.tv/)

Where: Microsoft NERD, maybe up on the cool 11th floor... http://bit.ly/msnerd... (http://bit.ly/msnerd)
