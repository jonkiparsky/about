Tonight's presentation is sponsored by RIFT.io (http://rift.io).

Twisted is a comprehensive networking framework built on asynchronous principles. Node.js and other tools have made async I/O all the rage, but Twisted was there first. Come learn about this extensive networking toolkit.

Patrick Cloke and Stephen DiCato will present. Starting from the very basics of asynchronous I/O, they'll explain how Twisted works, how to build simple services, and how to integrate Twisted with other services.

Pizza is provided by RIFT.io. (http://rift.io)

Drinks afterward at Meadhall, sponsored by Jana (http://jana.com).
