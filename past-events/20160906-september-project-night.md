An evening of friendly face-time, sponsored by Better Outcomes (http://www.betteroutcomes.com/). Better Outcomes is building a Google-scale database of medical records, healthcare insurance records, and patient reported outcomes.

Bring a laptop. Bring ideas. Bring questions. Bring enthusiasm. The Boston Python Project Night is a time to find others with compatible interests, and work away. Code, hack, teach, learn, meet, laugh, talk: it all happens at Project Night.

All skill levels are welcome. There will be at least two tables of beginning learners, and helpers for them. Other table-topics in the past have been Django, Data, Web Scraping, Hardware, Puzzle, Science, Art. Anything goes!

Pizza will be provided.
