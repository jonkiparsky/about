Two science talks, sponsored by Indico.

Jessica Smith: "Designing gene libraries using Python and integer programming"

DNA synthesis is the "write" of molecular biology, complementing
advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing over the last decade. In
this talk, I describe how to generate diverse libraries of DNA
synthesis products against biologically-relevant constraints using
python and integer programming.

Nezar Abdennur: "Exploring data at scale: Using HiGlass to browse, compare and share large quantitative datasets"

Features and patterns in large quantitative datasets are difficult to explore, compare, and communicate. We present the HiGlass web viewer and Python library for interactive and collaborative visual exploration and comparison of multiple multiscale datasets. Using a tile-based API, we demonstrate how data can be dynamically rendered on the client irrespective of its size on the server. For comparison between datasets we demonstrate multiple selectable modes for synchronized panning, zooming and value scaling. Finally, to share interactive views into the data, we store and disseminate the resumable viewer state as a "configuration" of data location, aesthetics and synchronizations. We will demonstrate the use of HiGlass on real data, including massive genomic datasets.
More information can be found on the HiGlass demo page (http://higlass.io), in the documentation (http://docs.higlass.io), or in the list of examples (http://higlass.io/examples). More information of the cooler file format for multiscale genomic sparse matrix data can be found at (https://mirnylab.github.io/cooler/).
