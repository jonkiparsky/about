The Open Data Science Conference (http://opendatascicon.com) is happening in Boston May 30-31. We have two speakers previewing their talks for us. The evening is sponsored by Cens.io (http://cens.io). Afterward we'll head over to Meadhall for drinks sponsored by Smarterer (http://smarterer.com).

Karen Rubin, How Women are Conquering the S&P 500

According to Credit Suisse’s Gender 3000 report, at the end of 2013, women accounted for 12.9% of top management in 3000 companies across 40 countries. However, since 2009, companies with women as 25-50% of their management team returned 22-29%. If companies with women in management outperform so dramatically, what would happen if you invested in women-led companies? Karen Rubin will explore this question and share her findings after running a 12-year investment simulation.

Keith Bourgoin, Using Python with Apache Storm and Kafka

As Python gains more and more traction in data science, the ability to interact with large scale data processing systems has greatly improved. Instead of being limited to what can fit on one's laptop or having to wait for a Hadoop job to complete, we can now tap into streaming datasets using systems like Apache's Storm and Kafka projects.

In this talk, we'll examine log-centric architectures using Kafka's message passing and Storms's stream processing capabilities. Then we'll go over two projects pykafka (https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka) and streamparse (https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse) which allow data scientists to take advantage of these systems from Python without having to deal with the headache of JVM interop.

Pizza will be provided.
