## Things to Read ##
Python is an immensely popular language, and explaining python is an immensely popular
activity. This section will attempt to guide you to the top-shelf stuff.
- we might decide to separate readings from exercises. mostly this is here because Ned
referred to the desire for a "Python Resources" page, which suggests at least readings 
and exercises

## Things To Watch (and listen to) ##
This might also be a thing. 

## Things To Do ##
It's often said that the best way to learn to write programs is to write programs. This page
lists a number of places you can go for ideas about what programs to write next to develop
your python skills. Some sites offer python-focused problems, which typically are aimed at 
helping you learn more about the language and how to use it more effecticely. Other sites 
offer challenges that can be solved in any language. These are typically aimed at helping 
you develop your programming skills and become a better at solving problems. 

Sites offering python-specific exercises:

- [exercism.io](exercism.io) is a multi-language learning platform with over 100 python-specific 
exercises
- [checkio.org](https://checkio.org/) offers python-specific exercises. Problems are solved 
in an integrated editor on the site. 
- [codingbat](https://codingbat.com/python) 
- [edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3)
- [snakify](https://snakify.org/en/)
- [practicity](https://practity.com/project/python/)
- [practicepython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/)
- [pynative.com](https://pynative.com/python-basic-exercise-for-beginners/)
- [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/) 
- [PyBites](https://codechalleng.es/bites/)

Sites offering language-agnostic coding challenges

- [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com) is a Christmas-themed problem set that has offered 25 new 
programming challenges each December since 2015. For competitive solvers, there is a scoring 
system based on how fast you can solve the problem. For the rest of us, there is a collection 
of well-made problems that challenge your ability to reason algorithmically. Problems range from
moderate to difficult.
- [rosalind.info](rosalind.info) is a bit of a hodge-podge, offering a well-curated collection
of problems introducing concepts in bioinformatics, a small set of introductory python problems,
and a collection of classical algorithms to implement. 
- [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) is great fun for the mathematically-minded. Over 650 
problems which ramp up rather quickly in difficulty. If you've got a strong mathematical 
background you'll have a real advantage here. If not, you might well acquire one.
