Boston Python is always looking for sponsors for its events. We'd love to have
you! Sponsoring brings a personal touch to your recruiting efforts. One recent
sponsor commented:

> Our Boston Python posting got a better response than the company's 'official'
  postings in IEEE journals, Monster.com, etc...

Sponsoring pizza for an in-person event is **$750**.  Other kinds of sponsorship are possible, such as picking up the tab at a bar after an event.  Sponsorship is also possible for online events, though that would be new for us.

On classic **presentation nights**, we have up to 100 people in attendance, sometimes more.  Our presentations focus on peer-to-peer technical content.  We avoid presentations that focus too much on commercial offerings.

**Project nights** are unstructured evenings where people group up based on interest, and then work on whatever they like. We have tables dedicated to beginning learners, web development, data science, hardware, and whatever other topics we decide are fitting. The unstructured time means that much more in-depth conversations are possible, which helps with assessing candidates' fit for the roles you are looking to fill. We generally get up to 80 people.

As a sponsor, you will get a chance to **speak to the crowd** at the event, and
pitch your company (or whatever it is you have to pitch). Sponsors generally
speak for a minute or two. Up to five minutes isn't unheard of, but starts to
feel long. People lose interest if the pitch is too lengthy.

When sponsoring **pizza**, a Boston Python organizer will purchase the pizza.
You can pay by making a donation to the Python Software Foundation at
<http://donate.bostonpython.com>.

The night of the event, we can provide table space for you to put out materials,
or hand out swag if you want, but that is not expected or required.

## Subscription sponsorship
We also offer a subscription model of sponsorship. Subscribing sponsors provide
a regular monthly contribution, and are acknowledged at all of our events and on
our online platforms, chiefly meetup.com and our
[sponsors page](our_sponsors.md). This model works best for some organizations'
budgeting models, and we'd be pleased to work with your organization to find an
approach that works for you.

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with the leadership team at
